1. Project Headline - The Banking Anomaly Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project aimed at detecting and analyzing fraudulent banking transactions using interactive visualizations and dynamic filters. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for fraud detection, risk assessment, and customer profiling based on transaction behavior.

2. Key Objectives:
Detect Fraud: Identify the number of fraudulent transactions within total banking activity.
Quantify Impact: Measure the total amount involved in fraudulent transactions.
Customer Segmentation: Analyze fraudulent activity by customer income range, occupation, and demographic characteristics.
Time-Based Trends: Drill down into fraud patterns by month and year to reveal seasonal or periodic spikes in anomalies.

3. Tools & Technologies
Power BI: Used for building interactive dashboards with dynamic filters, slicers, etc. Utilized for initial data cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing before importing into Power BI.
Datasource: Excel workbook (merging two excel sheets)
Data Preparation in Power BI (Power Query Editor)

4. Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and null values.
Standardized date formats and column headers.
Converted categorical data (e.g., income range, occupation) into consistent labels
Created new columns for year and month to support time-based analysis.

5. Insights from Analysis
Fraud Distribution: A small percentage of transactions were flagged as fraudulent, but they often involved higher-than-average transaction amounts.

Income Correlation: Fraudulent transactions were more prevalent in certain income brackets, indicating potential vulnerabilities or targeting patterns.

Occupational Risk: Specific occupations showed higher fraud rates, providing insight into risk segmentation.

Temporal Patterns: Peaks in fraudulent activity were observed in certain months and years, suggesting seasonal fraud trends or specific time-based attacks.

This dashboard enables:
Banking teams to proactively monitor fraudulent activities.
Data analysts to identify high-risk segments and periods.

Stakeholders to make informed decisions using interactive and visual insights.
